                <p>
                    Cloud storage allows you to save data and files in an off-site location that you access either
                     through the public internet or a dedicated private network connection. However, current implementations
                     of cloud storage can only save small files and the total space allocated in each solution is limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UNST is a tool that helps people store files into different storing environments. They can choose storing
                    environments and attach them to their UNST account and different ways of splitting their files into shards.
                    The main purpose of the application is allowing the users to store their files into multiple storage environments.

                    have quick access to all of their cloud storage environments. It can support big files with multiple formats
                    and it is able to distribute them into environments based on different criteria. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    UNST is an open source project with a small developer team that is trying to develop their first web application.
                    It is developed to run on both web and mobile.

                    not appear in production. Any bugs can be reported by the users on the github project page so that the developers can fix it as soon as possible.
