                <p>
                    Cloud storage allows you to save data and files in an off-site location that you access either
                     through the public internet or a dedicated private network connection. However, current implementations
                     of cloud storage can only save small files and the total space allocated in each solution is limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UNST is a tool that helps people store files into different storing environments. They can choose storing
                    environments and attach them to their UNST account and different ways of splitting their files into shards.
                    The main purpose of the application is allowing the users to store their files into multiple storage environments.
                </p>

                    UNST was developed for everyone that is struggling to organize their files and wants to be able to
                    have quick access to all of their cloud storage environments. It can support big files with multiple formats
                    and it is able to distribute them into environments based on different criteria. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    UNST is an open source project with a small developer team that is trying to develop their first web application.
                    It is developed to run on both web and mobile.

                However, in order to upload files, storing environments need to be linked to your account.

                <p>
                    This feature will handle all interactions between the user and his files. It lets the user create, edit or delete any of his files or folders. All the files will be 
                    stored in a format similar to the windows file system tree. After a file is uploaded by a user using the File manager page, the File manager microservice will set the 
                    access point for the file in the folder chosen by the user and it will pass the file to splitting microservice.

                <p>
                    This feature receives files from the file manager microservice and splits it into multiple shards based on the settings preferred by the user. The splitter will check first if
                    the file needs to be archived (users can also choose to skip this step). If so, the file will be archived using one of the available compressing algorithms (bzip2, gzip or zip).
                    After this step, the splitter will check what is the preferred method of distributing the file (fixed-size shards, percentage of remaining space in storage environments, fixed number of shards etc...)
                    and distribute the file following the specified rules in the available storage environments.

                <p>
                    This feature allows the user to download files from his File manager page. When a download request is made from the user, the File retriever will check in the database data related to the file (number of shards, location, name of shards, compressing method etc...)
                    and check if all of them are available(for instance a file could have shards on an environment that was unlinked from the account). If all the shards are recovered from the external storage environments, the file will be recomposed and decompressed (if necessary).
                    After the file is successfully decompressed the download will start following the specified maximum speed set by the user.

                <p>
                    This feature allows the user to keep track of his activity on the UNST app. This microservice handles the available space in the drives, the number of connected drives and other relevant information such as the compression rate of the files, the allocated space for each drive, the total number of files uploaded or data related to network traffic (Total uploaded,downloaded or most used file).
                </p>
                <p>Some operations supported by this microservice can generate plots/charts based on your activity showing the distribution of file types or by environments(in case you have a favourite). Another important feature for users might be the history of your uploads/downloads in the last 30 days. All this features should give the user an idea of how you manage your storage platform.</p>

                  This feature is the backbone of all the available features related to the user account. It allows the user tochange his personal information as well as information related to his files. From here
                  users can set or disconnect the storage environments and allocate a certain amount of them to the UNST application(just in case you still want to have a personal space unrelated to our application).
                  Other settings regarding the distribution method of files can also be set in this section (for example how big will a shard be or where will it be stored). If there is any customizable setting related to UNST users will find it here.

                  UNST is currently available only to the users that have an account on our application and at least one account on our supported external storage systems (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive). Therefore, anyone interested in our application needs to register before using the application.
                </p>
                <p>Once an account is created, the user can start using the application after logging in. Both Register and Login process use the OAuth method. The UNST team won't store your password account in the plain format but it is recommended that you use a different password from your other accounts.</p>

                    not appear in production. Any bugs can be reported by the users on the github project page so that the developers can fix it as soon as possible.

                    is stored by the UNST team. Your account password is stored in a hashed version so your information are not exposed to potential threats.
